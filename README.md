A utilities library with all the helpful code I've made across all of my projects.
This library includes

- A template for throwable items
- A template for slabs
- A template for stem crops (Melon/Pumpkin seeds)
- A template for fence gates
- Some reimplementations of modern entity functions
- A template for an item with simple tooltips
- [StationAPI PR #170](https://github.com/ModificationStation/StationAPI/pull/170)
- An Active Screen Handler for having hideable slots
- Backport of the Structure API from MC 1.0.0
- A bunch of utilities related to mathematics, rendering, textures, minecarts, etc.
- An implementation of NineSlices GUI (used by the chest template)
